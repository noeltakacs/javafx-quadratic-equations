## üì≤ How to download this app?
As of now, this application is not available for download as a standalone executable or mobile app, and it's currently provided only as source code.
You can access the application by downloading the ZIP file (or cloning the repository) and building the project in your IDE.

I recommend doing this via ``Visual Studio Code``
