## üì≤ How to download this app?
As of now, this application is not available for download as a standalone executable or mobile app, and it's currently provided only as source code.
You can access the application by downloading the ZIP file (or cloning the repository) and building the project in your IDE.

I recommend doing this via ``Visual Studio Code``

## ü´∂ How can you help?
This project holds a special place in my heart as it marks the beginning of my journey into the world of development. However, I must admit that it is far from perfect. The lack of proper documentation and comments in Slovak language might make it challenging for others to understand and contribute. Therefore, if someone is willing to help with documentation, I would be very grateful.

One of the biggest issues with the app is its non-responsiveness to different resolutions. As a result, it might not look as good on various monitors, and that's something I wish to improve.

Another aspect that I acknowledge is the plain design. I understand that aesthetics play a crucial role in user experience, and the current design might not be appealing to everyone. It's an area where I definitely need some assistance to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

In all honesty, the app has its fair share of problems beyond the ones mentioned here. However, I'm aware that every journey begins with the first step, and I am eager to learn and grow from this experience. I welcome any contribution, bug fixes, feature enhancements, or suggestions for improvement.
